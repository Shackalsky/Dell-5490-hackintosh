# Dell-5490-hackintosh
This EFI was made in order to boot Sonoma 14.6.1 on a stock Dell 5490.

It was based off juanpy0223's github post, and includes some fixes in order to make the 5490 work like it's supposed to. 

The SMBIOS is changed, so please if you're going to use this EFI, make sure everything's correct or set it up yourself

Have fun and successfull hackintoshing!
